Art has become much more accessible than any other time in history. Digital art gives us the
opportunity to experience works as well as places from around the world. I combine the physical,
real world with that of the digital realm to create immersive experiences for any user or viewer.
My work is a mixture of traditional and digital sculpture which I now use to educate the user on
current climate issues in our oceans. Aside from creating using bronze and ceramic clay, my
work mainly uses digital programs such as Unreal Engine which allow me to create 3D worlds
and techniques such as photogrammetry to turn the real world digital. In the past, my work was
very figurative due to my fascination with the incredible feats the human body can achieve. This
would transition to digital sculpting figures and would eventually lead me towards creating
digital worlds. Some pieces of mine represent my culture which I am very proud of. The journey
my parents went through to get from Greece to where they are today always pushes me to go
beyond any limitations I place on myself. I am always learning more about my Greek roots and
look to further explore our connection to the past and use my skills to immerse anyone in that
ancient world to experience an artistic version of that time. Currently, my work involves learning
more about our oceans and our coasts to create an educational and immersive environment.
Through art I find understanding of our world and my goal is to share that knowledge with as
many people as possible as knowledge belongs to everyone.
