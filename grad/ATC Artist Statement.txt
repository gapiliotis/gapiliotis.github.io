Our local coastline from Mexico, through California, Oregon and up to Washington is home to a forest most people have not visited. 
These kelp forests provide a habitat for so many species as well as provide us with air to live. However, due to a multitude of events 
and factors, there have been massive losses of this environment. This work involves learning more about our coasts and questioning our 
role as a society to create an educational and immersive environment that seeks to bring awareness and understanding to the current 
state of our coast. It is easy to lose sight of what is important, especially when most people have never seen it.

Digital art gives us the opportunity to experience works as well as places from around the world. I combine the physical, real 
world with that of the digital realm to create this immersive environment for any user or viewer. This work uses Unreal Engine 5, 
a video game engine, which allows me to create 3D worlds and use techniques such as photogrammetry to turn the real world digital 
through photography. 

As an art educator, I have been able to use these skills to combine practice and education.
